        "# **1. What is the Difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**   \n",
        "  - Both multithreading and multiprocessing are techniques used in Python to achieve parallelism or concurrency, which means performing multiple tasks at the same time. However, they differ in how they use the CPU, memory, and how they execute tasks.     \n",
        "  **1. Multithreading**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Multithreading means running multiple threads (smaller units of a process) within a single process.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - All threads share the same memory space, variables, and resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - It is best suited for I/O-bound tasks, such as reading files, downloading data from the internet, or handling user input, where the program spends time waiting rather than computing.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Threads communicate easily since they share memory, but care must be taken to avoid conflicts using thread synchronization methods like locks or semaphores.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - However, in Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, which limits true parallel execution for CPU-heavy tasks.    \n",
        "  **Example (Multithreading):**    \n",
        "  import threading    \n",
        "  def display():    \n",
        "    for i in range(3):    \n",
        "        print(\"Thread running:\", threading.current_thread().name)     \n",
        "    *Creating multiple threads*       \n",
        "t1 = threading.Thread(target=display)     \n",
        "t2 = threading.Thread(target=display)     \n",
        "  t1.start()    \n",
        "t2.start()    \n",
        "  t1.join()     \n",
        "t2.join()   \n",
        "print(\"All threads finished!\")    \n",
        "  **2. Multiprocessing**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Multiprocessing means running multiple processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - It allows true parallelism, as each process can execute on a separate CPU core.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - It is ideal for CPU-bound tasks, such as performing heavy calculations, data processing, or image manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Processes do not share memory directly, so they use Inter-Process Communication (IPC) through queues or pipes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Since each process runs independently, it avoids the GIL limitation and can fully utilize multiple CPU cores.     \n",
        "  **Example (Multiprocessing):**      \n",
        "from multiprocessing import Process     \n",
        "def compute_square(num):    \n",
        "    print(\"Square:\", num * num)     \n",
        "if __name__ == \"__main__\":    \n",
        "    numbers = [2, 3, 4]     \n",
        "    processes = []      \n",
        "for n in numbers:       \n",
        "        p = Process(target=compute_square, args=(n,))       \n",
        "        processes.append(p)       \n",
        "        p.start()     \n",

        "# **2. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**\n",
        "  - Memory management in Python is an essential part of how the language stores and releases data. Python provides automatic memory management through its built-in garbage collector and reference counting mechanism, but there are still several challenges that developers face when working with large or complex programs.   \n",
        "**1. Overview of Memory Management in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Python uses a private heap space to store all objects and data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The Python memory manager allocates space for objects and controls their lifecycle.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Two key techniques are used:    \n",
        "  1.Reference Counting – keeps track of how many references point to each object.     \n",
        "  2.Garbage Collection (GC) – reclaims memory from objects that are no longer reachable (like in cyclic references).    \n",
        "  **2. Common Challenges in Memory Management**       \n",
        "  **(a) Reference Counting Overhead**\n",
        "  - Every Python object has a reference counter.    \n",
        "  - Each time a variable references an object, the count increases; when a reference is deleted, the count decreases.     \n",
        "  - This adds extra processing overhead, especially when dealing with millions of small objects.    \n",
        "  - It also increases memory usage because every object stores its own reference counter.     \n",
        "  **Example:**    \n",
        "  import sys    \n",
        "  x = [1, 2, 3]     \n",
        "  print(sys.getrefcount(x))  # Shows how many references exist to object x    \n",
        "**(b) Circular References**\n",
        "  - Circular references occur when two or more objects refer to each other, forming a loop.\n",
        "  - For example, object A refers to object B, and object B refers to object A.\n",
        "  - In such cases, reference counts never drop to zero, so the garbage collector must detect and break the cycle.\n",
        "  - However, the detection process itself can be slow and resource-intensive.  \n",
        "  **Example:**      \n",
        "  class Node:   \n",
        "    def __init__(self):     \n",
        "        self.ref = None   \n",
        "    a = Node()    \n",
        "  b = Node()    \n",
        "  a.ref = b     \n",
        "  b.ref = a  # Circular reference     \n",
        "  **(c) Memory Fragmentation**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Python allocates memory in chunks from the operating system.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Over time, as objects are created and destroyed, memory can become fragmented, meaning free memory is spread out in small, unusable pieces.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - This leads to inefficient memory utilization and reduced performance in long-running applications.    \n",
        "  **(d) Retaining Unused Objects (Memory Leaks)**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Even though Python has garbage collection, memory leaks can still happen when references to unused objects remain.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - For example, large lists, global variables, or caches that are never cleared can keep objects alive unnecessarily.    \n",
        "  **Example:**\n",
        "  data = []       \n",
        "  for i in range(1000000):      \n",
        "    data.append(str(i))  # Memory grows continuously    \n",
        "   'data' never cleared; memory leak continues     \n",
        "  **(e) Object Overhead**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Every Python object carries extra memory metadata, such as type information, reference count, and object pointers.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - This means even small data structures consume more memory compared to lower-level languages like C or C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - For large datasets, this overhead becomes significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **(f) External Libraries and C Extensions**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Some third-party libraries (especially written in C/C++) do not fully integrate with Python’s garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - If these extensions do not properly release memory, it can lead to hidden memory leaks that Python cannot detect or clean.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **(g) Shared Mutable Objects**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - When using multithreading or multiprocessing, shared mutable objects can lead to memory inconsistency or duplication.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Copying data between processes can increase memory usage if not handled properly (e.g., large NumPy arrays).    \n",
        "  **3. Tools to Monitor and Manage Memory in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - To handle these challenges, Python developers use several tools:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - gc module → to manually control garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - tracemalloc → tracks memory allocation by line of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - objgraph → visualizes object references and memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - memory_profiler → shows which parts of the code use the most memory.\n",
        "  **4. Best Practices to Overcome Memory Challenges**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Delete unused objects using del to free memory manually.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Avoid circular references where possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Use generators instead of large lists to handle data streams.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Clear large containers (list.clear(), dict.clear()) when they are no longer needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Prefer immutable objects (tuples) over mutable ones when appropriate.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Use weak references via the weakref module to reference objects without increasing their reference count.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Monitor memory usage with profiling tools during development.       \n",
        "  **5. Conclusion**       \n",
        "  - While Python automates most of its memory management through reference counting and garbage collection, developers must still be cautious about memory leaks, circular references, and large object retention.    \n",
        "  Efficient programming practices, proper data structure selection, and regular profiling help overcome these challenges and ensure optimal memory usage in Python applications.   \n",

        "  **3.Function divide_numbers(a, b):**\n",
        "  - The try block attempts to divide the two numbers.\n",
        "  - If a ZeroDivisionError occurs, the except block handles it.\n",
        "  - The error is logged to the log file instead of crashing the program.\n",
